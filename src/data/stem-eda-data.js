Students prepare for a fact-finding mission where they will send a drone to the planet to collect data. The data will help them determine whether or not human life can be sustained on the new planet. They will use the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 as the platform for simulating the mission. Through the engineering design process, they learn to code using the EV3-G programming language, which will help them program the EV3 to achieve the goals of the mission.",
